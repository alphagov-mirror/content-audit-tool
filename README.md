# Content Performance Manager

`Provide content designers across all of government with the data and tooling they need to measure and improve ‘their’ GOV.UK content.`

This is an app that aggregates metrics from multiple sources to give easy view of content performance measurements.

### Setting up the application

The application contains a [setup script](./bin/setup) that will perform the
steps required to bootstrap the application.

```bash
$ ./bin/setup
```

### Running the application
#### Using the GDS development VM

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/getting-started.html) for instructions about setting up and running your development VM.

In the development VM, go to:

```bash
cd /var/govuk/govuk-puppet/development-vm
```

Then run:

 ```bash
 bowl content-audit-tool
 ```

The application can be accessed from:

http://content-audit-tool.dev.gov.uk

To run the test suite:
 ```bash
 $ bundle exec rake
 ```

 or you can also use [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), see [list commands](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/List-of-Guard-Commands)

 ```bash
 $ bundle exec guard
 ```

### Using Docker

[Docker] configuration files are included should you wish to develop the
application in a container. A [compose][docker compose] configuration is
included that defines all the services needed to run the application.

Use the [GOV.UK replication scripts] to download a copy of the application data:

```commandline
$ cd /path/to/govuk-puppet/development-vm/replication/
$ ./sync-postgresql.sh -n postgresql-primary-1.backend.integration
```

Set an environmental variable pointing to the PostgreSQL backup. This is then
mounted as a volume on the PostgreSQL container so that the application
database is restored when the container is created. See the
[official PostgreSQL Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) for more
information.

```commandline
$ echo "DATABASE_BACKUP=/path/to/govuk-puppet/development-vm/replication/backups/postgresql/postgresql-primary-1.backend.integration/latest/content_audit_tool_production_XXXX-XX-XX_XXhXXm.Day.sql.gz" > .env
```

Create and start the containers:

```commandline
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Apply any database migrations created after the database import was taken:

```commandline
$ docker-compose exec app rails db:migrate
```

Launch the application:

```commandline
$ open http://localhost:3000/
```

To run the test suite:

```commandline
$ docker-compose exec app rails db:setup RAILS_ENV=test
$ docker-compose exec app rake
```
