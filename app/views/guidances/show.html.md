# Audit GOV.UK content

Guidance to help you understand the questions on the audit tool before you start auditing content.

---

## Does the title need to change?

Titles should:

* be 65 characters or less
* be unique, clear and descriptive
* be front-loaded and optimised for search
* use a colon to break up longer titles
* not contain dashes or slashes
* not have a full stop at the end
* not use acronyms unless they are well-known, like EU
* not include the format type, for example 'form' or 'consultation'

References: [Style guide (Titles)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#titles) and [Writing for GOV.UK (Titles)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#titles)

### Consider

Check whether the title would make sense:

* in a list
* in search results
* in collections

Are there acronyms that are widely known that don’t need spelling out? For example, HMRC, DVLA.

#### Good example

> Hand luggage restrictions at UK airports

#### Bad example
> Addendum to the 2002 Guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on environmental objectives relating to the exercise of its air aviation functions"

Reason: Too long and repeats what’s in the summary.

#### Alternative

> Updates to Civil Aviation Authority environmental guidance since 2002

---

## Does the summary need to change?

Summaries should:

* be 160 characters
* not repeat the title


Use terms that you know users are searching for, as you would when you write the content. Summaries are a good place to include alternative search terms that aren’t in the content.

References: [Writing for GOV.UK: titles and summaries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#titles-and-summaries) and [How to optimise your content for search](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/data-and-analytics#how-to-optimise-your-content-for-search)

### Consider

What terms can be drawn from the content, and do they feature in the summary?

#### Good example

> Handbook and software to help assess the risks of contaminated land exposure for human health.

#### Bad example

> Complete if you are applying for a new permit, applying to change or transfer an existing permit.

Reason: It’s not clear what or who the permit is for.

#### Alternative

> Complete the application to apply for a new environmental permit, or apply to change or transfer a standard facilities permit you already have.

## Does the page detail need to change?

Page detail (body text) should:

* begin with what’s most important to users (not to government)
* be concise and easy to scan (with subheadings every 3-5 paragraphs)
* be written in plain English (no jargon) and be easy to understand
* use short sentences - ideally no more than 25 words
* define acronyms and abbreviations the first time they’re used (with Markdown)
* explain any technical terms
* be shorter than 500 words if possible

Reference: [Structuring your content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#structuring-content)

### Consider

Is content in the correct tense? For example,

> applications will close on 2 February 2015’ should be changed to say ‘applications closed…

Replace a minister's name with their role. For example, change

> Claire Perry opened…

to

> the Rail Minister opened…

Is there content that's no longer relevant? Or is there content that can be removed or repositioned so that the most important content is at the top?

Has $CTA (call to action markdown) been used to 'highlight' content?

#### Good example

> List of post holders who can receive driving tests and instructors statistics up to 24 hours before release to the general public.

Reason: It gives detail on who this is for, what it’s used for and when the statistics will be available.

#### Bad example

> Index table of vehicle

Reason: Doesn’t give any detail on what a user would need this for or what the table represents.

#### Alternative

> "A list of vehicle licensing statistics that shows how many vehicles were registered and licensed in 2013. This includes cars, motorcycles, light vans, HGVs, buses and coaches."

## Do the attachments need to change?

An attachment should be flagged for improvement if:

* there is no organisational branding - there should at least be a logo; exceptions include reports produced by consultants, but they'll generally include the consultant’s logo

* it is no longer current - the attachment needs to have a 'withdrawn' message added, such as in this [old webTAG unit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/603749/webtag-tag-unit-a1-3-user-and-provider-impacts-november-2014.pdf)

* it links to the incorrect place on an agency website, e.g. a generic homepage instead of the specific document required

References: [Viewing government documents](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents) and [Open formats](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/planning-content#open-formats)

### Consider

There should only be multiple attachments on a publication page when the attachments are:

* a form and its guidance

* 'chapters' of one document

* 'versions' of the same document, for example an interim report and a final report

* multiple language versions of the same document

It’s fine to have multiple attachments on a consultation page.

With a PDF, can you:

* tag it for accessibility?

* convert it to PDF/A-2a?

* add an HTML or ODT version?

* longer term, consider removing it entirely if there's an HTML version?

With a form, you can replace it with an editable PDF, ODT, ODS or an online form.

With a spreadsheet, can you:

* replace an Excel sheet with a CSV or ODS - or HTML tables?

* replace a spreadsheet ‘calculator’ with an online form?

#### Good example

> [Infant immunisation poster](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infant-immunisation-poster)

#### Bad example

> [Format 2 - PDF - Times and heights of high and low waters, split into morning and afternoon, one month per page, with a table drawn around the date (A4 portrait)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukho-tidal-prediction-service-sample-pdf-format-two)

Reason: Attachment name is front loaded incorrectly and is too long, it repeats what’s in the page title and summary. The PDF doesn’t have the organisation branding, and should be in HTML table format for better accessibility.

* * *


## Does the format need to change?

It’s important that guidance content is published in one of the guidance formats so that users have a more complete journey from start to finish. 

User guidance takes a user through completing a task, for example [Become a driving examiner](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/become-a-driving-examiner).

The main guidance formats in Whitehall Publisher are:

* [Detailed guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#detailed-guide) - answers a specific, task-oriented user need

* [Publication: guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#guidance) - non-statutory documents that offer advice

* [Publication: statutory guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#statutory-guidance) - guidance that users are legally obliged to follow

* [Publication: form](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#form) - forms, and instructions on how to fill them in

* [Publication: regulations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#regulations) - regulations imposed by an independent regulatory authority

* [Manuals](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#manual) - long, complex, chaptered documents, usually for specialists

Reference: [List and explanation of all GOV.UK content types](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types)

### Consider

Add guidance about completing a form to the form page. Use the 'Form' format for the page.

Check that content published as ‘Correspondence’ isn't actually guidance, policy, a 'Decision' or a 'Notice'.

Make sure that 'Promotional material’ content isn't actually 'Correspondence' or guidance.

Withdraw interim reports rather than merging them with final reports.

If the attachment is an electronic version of a printed leaflet and addresses user needs that are already met elsewhere ([INS57P: information on driving licences](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ins57p-information-on-driving-licences), for example) use the format 'Promotional material' and add it to a leaflet collection.

#### Good example

> [Car and small van driving syllabus](http://alphagov.github.io/govuk-content-best-practices/snapshots/car-and-small-van-driving-syllabus) (demo content)

#### Bad example

> [Discussion paper in ‘Guidance’ format - should be ‘Policy’](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/airports-commission-discussion-papers--2)

Reason: It’s informing users of a policy discussion, not taking them through completing a task.

* * *


## Is the content is out of date?

Content is out of date if the information is no longer correct or it has been superseded by another document.

Out of date content should be:

* withdrawn - if a record of it still needs to be available, for example previous instructions on how to assess an ongoing project

* merged or consolidated into another page, and unpublished - if there is duplicate content, or using the old content will cause legal problems; for example, superseded instructions

Reference: [Withdrawing and unpublishing content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/gov-uk-content-retention-and-withdrawal-archiving-policy)

### Consider

Does the content refer to a date that's already passed? For example, "[Central to the strategy is the ring-fencing of £35 million funding per year, until 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-for-all-stations)".

Does it help users complete a task that’s still relevant?

#### Good example

> [Disabled parking badges](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/disabled-parking-badges-statistics)

#### Bad example

> [Rail passenger franchises from 2005](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rail-passenger-franchises)

Reason: It's an old invitation to tender. It needs to be reviewed to check it's still being used, and if there are any other pages it could be merged with. If not, it can be withdrawn.

---

## Is this content very similar to other pages? 

The content is similar to other pages if:

* there is duplicate content on another page
* the title matches another page

If you select ‘yes’, add the destination url in the ‘Where should users be redirected to?’ (optional) text box. 

### Consider

Check if there are similar pages by searching GOV.UK with the title of the content. Have different agencies duplicated the same kind of content?

#### Example

> [Driving tests and instructors statistics notes and definitions](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/driver-and-rider-tests-and-instructor-statistics-2012-13) should be merged with [Driver and rider tests and instructor statistics: 2012-13](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/driver-and-rider-tests-and-instructor-statistics-2012-13), so the guidance notes are in the same place as the statistics.

---

## Should the content be removed?

The content should be removed if:

* the page is a duplicate
* information is out-of-date
* content can be merged with a similar page
* content was published in error

If you select 'yes’, add the destination url in the 'Where should users be redirected to? (optional)' text box.

References: [Withdrawing and unpublishing content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/gov-uk-content-retention-and-withdrawal-archiving-policy) and [Unpublishing content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/gov-uk-content-retention-and-withdrawal-archiving-policy#unpublishing-content)

### Consider

Does the page contain information that's easily available elsewhere?
